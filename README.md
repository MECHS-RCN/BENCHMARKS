# A Benchmark Control Problem for Real-Time Hybrid Simulation
A benchmark problem statement for real-time hybrid simulation (RTHS) of a seismically excited building has been developed, and is presented to the community with the aim to advance the field. Although numerous RTHS control algorithms have been examined in recent years with computational simulation, few verifications have been validated in the laboratory or with realistic models that include uncertainty. This RTHS benchmark control problem has been developed to address this gap. It includes realistic models of the physical components, parametric uncertainties, and control constraints. We anticipate that the lessons learned through this benchmark problem will provide a clear basis for evaluating the efficacy of various transfer system control strategies and expose research questions.
